# ProudLock
Be proud of that lock

-----

ProudLock enables the Face ID latch glyph, internally called SBUIProudLockIconView, on older devices.

~~This tweak it at first **source code only**, which means there is no .deb file you can download or install.~~  
Now with an installable package! Does not work on iPhone X, because it already has the Face ID latch glyph.

**Compatibility**
* iPhone (except iPhone X)
* iPad

*Requires iOS 11 and Touch ID*

### Known Issues
* Date, Notifications, Widgets and controls need to be moved down properly (reacting to scrolling on different views), and I don't know how to do that.'
